# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my **DSA solutions in Java**, including **basic to advanced problems** from LeetCode, categorized by topics.

## 📌 Topics Covered  
- ✅ 1️⃣ Pattern Printing  
- ✅ 2️⃣ Arrays  
- ✅ 3️⃣ 2D Arrays & Multidimensional Arrays  
- ✅ 4️⃣ Strings & StringBuilders  
- ✅ 5️⃣ Sorting Algorithms (Basic & Advanced)

## 📂 Folder Structure  
Each topic has its own folder containing solutions to related LeetCode problems, and the order of topics is structured to **build logic step-by-step**.

    // should study according to the order example : PatternPrinting0 -> at end 0 is there then you should start from here and inside also at the end of file name i have mentioned numbers ex : 0,1,2,3... etc  (you should start from 0 and 1 etc)
  - 0 PatternPrinting => you should study first => inside folder also i have mentioned serial numbers after file name
  - 1 Arrays 
  - 2 2D Arrays & Multidimensional Arrays
  .......
