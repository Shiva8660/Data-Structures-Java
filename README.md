## 📂 Folder Structure  
Each topic has its own folder containing solutions to related LeetCode problems, and the order of topics is structured to **build logic step-by-step**.

    // should study according to the order example : PatternPrinting0 -> at end 0 is there then you should start from here and inside also at the end of file name i have mentioned numbers ex : 0,1,2,3... etc  (you should start from 0 and 1 etc)
  - 0 PatternPrinting => you should study first => inside folder also i have mentioned serial numbers after file name
  - 1 Arrays 
  - 2 2D Arrays & Multidimensional Arrays
  .......
  .......


## 🎯 Goals  
✔️ Solve **300+ LeetCode problems**  
✔️ Maintain **clean, well-documented code**  
✔️ Prepare for **placements & technical interviews**
